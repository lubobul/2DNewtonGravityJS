# 2DNewtonGravityJS

##Author
Lyubomir Dimitrov Stoychev

##About
This tool is written in pure JavaScript and is intended for experimenting with Newton's universal gravitation in 2D environment. Adding too many objects to the simulation may exeed the capabilities of your CPU, thus resulting in lower FPS.

##Goals for later versions
- Revisit the whole app
- Naming conventions
- Variables
- Code styling
- Use of classes (ES6)
- Possible optimizations?
- Tweak UX?
